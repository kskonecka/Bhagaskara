# A responsive website with one-page layout


Bhagaskara is my first fully responsive website that I built after 6 weeks of learning coding.

It is written with HTML, Sass (CSS), and jQuery.

The whole page is written from a scratch; I did not use any ready-to-go libraries (except for jQuery).

Its responsiveness is focused on mobile screens (max-width 500px), as its big-screen version works well on tablet screens.
